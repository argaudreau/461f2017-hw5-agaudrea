# Adam Gaudreau's GUI1 HW5
This repository contains my homework 5 submission.

## Purpose
The goal of this assignment is to build off of the assignment in HW4, located [here](https://github.com/argaudreau/461f2017-hw4-agaudrea), except use the JQuery Validation plugin to validate inputs.

## "Impress Me"
I added one additional field - current gas price - so a helpful calculation can be made, which is to see how much
100,000 miles of travel will cost you in gas, on top of the MSRP, so you can see a true price of the car. This is
displayed right alongside the original value in the chart but is coded in a differnt color so it is easy to see the
difference. In addition, the animations and progress bar make it easy for the user to see what step they are on, and
how long to complete the task.
